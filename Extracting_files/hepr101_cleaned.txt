Discuss in pairs.
1. Why are qualities like humour and wit important in a person?
2. Why do you think kings and queens preferred to have witty people
among their courtiers?
3. If you were asked to solve a disagreement between two people, what
approach would you take?
4. Have you ever been in a situation where a small misunderstanding
led to a big problem? How was it resolved?
Let us read
The Vijayanagara Empire was renowned for its glory, wealth,
and cultural achievements. Among its many illustrious rulers,
King Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509–29 CE) stood out as a wise
and powerful monarch. His reign is often referred to as the
Golden Era of the Vijayanagara Empire, a
time when art, literature, and architecture
flourished. A great patron of learning,
Krishnadeva Raya was not only an eminent
warrior but also a gifted poet. His works,
such as the epic Amuktamalyada and the
Sanskrit drama Jambavati Parinayam, are
acclaimed even today.Wit and Wisdom
Krishnadeva Raya’s court was home to eight celebrated poets,
collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas. These poets, including
Allasani Peddana and Tenali Ramakrishna, enriched the literary
tradition with their masterpieces. Tenali Ramakrishna, in
particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning
him a special place in the king’s court as both a poet and a witty
advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable
problems made him a beloved figure in the empire’s history.
Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one
such time, the king had a quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal,
over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a
single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her
altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the
once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn.
Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve
the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she

decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama,
the court’s brilliant and witty poet. Rama
listened patiently as the queen recounted
the incident in detail.
“The king wrote a poem,” she began, her
voice trembling. “It was filled with vague
expressions—sun, moon, stars, beautiful
sky—but it made no sense. When he tried
vague: unclearPoorvi
reciting it to his ministers, they all avoided him, making excuses.
It was late evening when he came to me, seeking an audience. He
began reciting it to me, but I was so exhausted after a tiring day
that I yawned— not once, but several times. The king thought I
was disrespecting his poem and stormed off. Since then, he has
not spoken to me. If I had known this would happen I would
have chosen another day. Help me, please, Rama. Only you can
help the king understand.”

Rama nodded thoughtfully. “If you like, I will try my best to
resolve this matter, Your Highness. But this needs a well-planned
approach, and I may need time to find the right strategy.” The
queen, who had placed her last hope in Rama, agreed and
thanked him profusely.
The next morning, the royal court was bustling with activity.
Ministers, scholars, and courtiers filled the courtroom, its
intricately carved pillars towering towards the high ceiling. Rays
of sunlight streamed through the open windows, illuminating
the floor adorned with exquisite rugs. Despite the lively chatter,
a tension hung in the air. The king sat on his ornate throne,
his expression stern, his sharp eyes scanning the room. It was
evident that the unresolved quarrel still gnawed at him.Wit and Wisdom
The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation
in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their
ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while
others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions,
Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing
everyone with an amused smile.
Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died
down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne,
carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, “Your
Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If
these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the
current results.”
A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known
for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, “I
wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he’ll claim they grow
without water.” Another muttered, “Perhaps he found them on
the moon!” Snickers rippled through the court.
The king frowned, unimpressed. “That sounds absurd,” he
muttered. “Such cultivation would need special soil, manure,
and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to
go wrong, our farmers would suffer.”
Rama smiled, unfazed. “That may be true, Your Majesty, but the
real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person
who sows them.”

A hush fell over the court as Rama’s words hung in the air.
The king’s eyebrows furrowed. “What is wrong with the person
who sows the seeds? Speak clearly, Rama!” he roared.
Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the
sceptical eyes of the courtiers. “If one were to sow seeds without
proper care, no one would reap a good harvest,” he said, pausing
for effect. “And what if the person had a habit of yawning while
sowing? Wouldn’t the seeds scatter unevenly?”
The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced
by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed
and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then
continued, “Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does
not yawn? It is as natural as breathing.”
The king’s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind
raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered
scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem.
He realised how unfair he had been. “If I had known that yawning
was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn’t have taken her gesture
so personally,” he thought, regret filling his heart.Wit and Wisdom

That evening, the king approached the queen with a softened
expression. “Thirumalambal,” he began, his voice gentle, “I have
been foolish. I see now that I overreacted. I let my pride blind
me. I’m so sorry.”
The queen, who had longed for this moment, smiled and replied,
“If you like, we can leave this quarrel behind us. I would very
much like to listen to your poem.”
Rama, who had orchestrated this settlement, felt victorious. The
king and the queen later presented him with valuable gifts for
his service. The royal couple’s bond was restored, and the palace
brimmed once again with joy and laughter.
Let us discuss
I Rectify the following false statements from the text.
1. The queen insulted the king by speaking against the quality of his
poem.
2. Tenali Rama immediately went to the king and convinced him to talk
to the queen.
3. The courtiers admired the king’s poem and praised his literary talent.
4. The ministers in the court were eager to hear Tenali Rama’s idea
about paddy cultivation.
5. The king never realised his mistake and continued to stay angry with
the queen.
Let us think and reflect
I Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

off. Since then, he has not spoken to me. If I had known this
would happen I would have chosen another day. Help me,

Rama nodded thoughtfully. “If you like, I will try my best
to resolve this matter, Your Highness. But this needs a
well-planned approach and I may need time to find the right
strategy.”

I Read the narrative essay given below.
A Lesson in Responsibility
One bright Monday morning, I woke up to the sounds of birds chirping
loudly. For once, I wasn’t late for school. My uniform was neatly laid out,
and my homework was already packed in my bag. I felt proud of myself
for being so organised. But little did I know, the day would still teach me
an important lesson.
During the morning assembly, our teacher, Mrs. Rao, announced a
surprise Science quiz. My heart skipped a beat. I had studied the chapter
a week ago, but I had forgotten to revise it over the weekend. As I sat at
my desk with the question paper in front of me, I froze. The questions
looked familiar, yet I couldn’t recall the answers clearly. I tried my best
to focus, but it wasn’t enough. Later, when the results were announced,
I scored much lower than I expected. Disappointed, I spoke to Mrs. Rao
after the class. She smiled and said, “It’s not about how much you know
but how consistently you prepare. Small efforts add up every day.”
Her words stayed with me. From that day on, I made it a habit to revise my
lessons regularly, even if there wasn’t an immediate test. Responsibility
isn’t just about being on time or finishing tasks—it’s about being ready
for what’s unexpected.
Now, work in pairs and check () if the following features are present in

plants between the stones, which the speaker thinks must be so small
that they are planted with a 5. _. One day, Mrs. Jones invites the

IV Pick examples of alliteration from the poem.
V A refrain is a repeated line or phrase that appears in each stanza.
Identify the refrain from the poem.
VI Irony is a literary device that emphasises the difference between what is
expected and what actually happens. It often involves a situation where
the outcome is the opposite of what is expected, creating a surprising or
a humorous effect. For example, Mrs. Jones’ excitement about her garden
contrasts with the speaker’s disappointment on how ordinary it is.
Identify the line(s) from the poem that display(s) situational irony.
VII Complete the following sentences appropriately.
1. The word ‘concrete’ can refer to _ in Mrs. Jones’ garden.

(metaphorical) meaning. Such word play is called a pun. A pun is a figure
of speech that uses words with multiple meanings or words that sound
alike but have different meanings, creating a humorous effect.

samples preserved for long-term study,
usually in the form of dried and pressed
plants mounted on paper.
Now, collect some fallen flowers and
leaves from your neighbourhood. Place
them in folds of a newspaper carefully
and put a pile of books on them. After
one week, take them out and use them to
make a card, wall hanging or any other
artwork. A sample has been given for
your reference.
III Read and enjoy the poem.
A Sea of Foliage
A sea of foliage girds our garden round,
But not a sea of dull unvaried green,
Sharp contrasts of all colours here are seen;
The light-green graceful tamarinds abound
Amid the mango clumps of green profound,
And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;
And o’er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,
Red—red, and startling like a trumpet’s sound.
But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges
Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon
Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes
Into a cup of silver. One might swoon
Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze
On a primeval Eden, in amaze.

The Merchant
Two Sentries
Setting
A road leading to Ujjain, visible in the
distance. Later, the King’s court, adorned
with rich tapestries, tall pillars, and
regal decor. The time is midday.
Scene I: The Road to Ujjain
(Four young men—Ram Datt, Shiv Datt, Har Datt, and
Dev Datt—are walking along a dusty road leading to
Ujjain. They appear travel-worn but resolute, their
eyes fixed on the city that looms ahead. The sun is
high, and the distant noise of the bustling city faintly
reaches them.)

Ram Datt : (Wiping his brow) Wehavejourneyedfarfromhome,
yet the prospect of finding work still eludes us.
Har Datt : How long has it been since we left our village?
Shiv Datt : I believe it has been over a week—perhaps even
longer.
Ram Datt : Ten days, to be precise. Every day feels longer than
the last.
Dev Datt
: Ten days are but a short span in the grand scheme
of things. We may still have many more roads to
wander before we find employment befitting all
four of us.
Ram Datt : If only we could secure an audience with the King
of Ujjain. I am confident he would recognise our
talents and appoint us to his service.
Shiv Datt : I share your belief.
Dev Datt : Indeed, we ought to be united in this hope. That is
why we press on towards Ujjain.
Har Datt : (Pausing thoughtfully) Gaining an audience with the
King is no simple task. We need to devise a strategy.
Dev Datt : Let us reach the city gates first. We can deliberate
once we are closer.
(As they walk, Ram Datt notices something on the
ground.)
devise: (here)

deliberate: to

Shiv Datt : Look there, friends. A camel has passed this way.
The tracks are fresh.
Ram Datt : (Studying the tracks) Yes, let us observe them as we
continue. They may tell us more than meets the eye.
(The four men continue walking, occasionally
stopping to examine the camel’s tracks. They
scrutinise every detail, exchanging glances but
saying little.)
Ram Datt : I
have
discovered
something
peculiar
about
this camel.
Shiv Datt : So have I.
Har Datt : I, too, have noticed a strange detail.
Dev Datt : (Smiling) It seems each of us has learnt something
unique, yet I believe my discovery is unlike any
of yours.
Har Datt : Let us rest beneath a large tree and share our
findings. But wait—someone approaches in haste!
Shiv Datt : (Peering ahead) It appears to be a merchant,
running as if pursued by trouble.
Ram Datt : A
merchant
indeed,
and
judging
by
his
countenance, he has lost something of great
value—perhaps his camel.
(The Merchant, panting and distressed, reaches the
group. He pauses to catch his breath, then addresses
them anxiously.)

(Breathlessly) Good day, kind sirs.

I seek your help. My camel has gone astray. Have
you, by chance, seen it?
Ram Datt : Is your camel lame in one leg, by any chance?
Merchant :
(Surprised) Yes, yes, it is!
Shiv Datt : Is it blind in the right eye?
Merchant :
Precisely! It is blind in one eye—the right one, as
you say.
Har Datt : And does it have a short tail?
Merchant :
(Astonished) You describe it perfectly! Yes, it has a
short tail.
Dev Datt :
Tell me, sir, has it not been suffering from a pain
in the stomach?
Merchant :
(Taken aback) How could you possibly know that?
The poor creature has been unwell for two weeks
now. Surely you are a healer! I will gladly pay
your fee if you can cure it. But tell me, where is my
camel?
Ram Datt :
We regret to inform you that we do not know
where it is.
astray: away
from the
correct pathPoorvi
Shiv Datt : We have not seen your camel, not even once.
Merchant : (Indignant) How can that be? You speak of my
camel as if it stood before you, yet you dare to
claim not to have seen it! You are deceivers! You
must have stolen it and sold it off. I will take this
matter to the King himself.
Dev Datt : You are free to do as you wish, sir. If the King
desires our presence, we shall be waiting under
that banyan tree yonder.
Merchant : I do not trust your words. I will not leave you here
to slip away. You shall come with me to face the
King!
All Four : Very well. We shall go to the King.
(They follow the Merchant towards the city gates. As
they arrive at the palace, the Merchant speaks urgently
to a Sentry. The Sentry leads the Merchant inside.)

Scene II: The King’s Court
(The King of Ujjain sits upon his throne, surrounded
by courtiers. The grand hall is adorned with rich
draperies, tall columns, and a golden canopy. The
King, regal in his bearing, watches intently as the
Merchant and the Sentry bow before him.)
King
: (Commanding) What is the matter that brings you
to my court?
Sentry
: Your Highness, this merchant has come with a
grievance against four travellers. He accuses them
of stealing his camel.
King
: Bring forth the accused.
(The Sentry bows and exits, returning shortly with
the four young men. They bow respectfully before
the King, maintaining calm despite the accusations
against them.)
King
: (To the Merchant) Speak your accusation clearly.
I shall not tolerate any confusion in my court.
Merchant : Your Majesty, these men know every detail of my
missing camel, yet they insist they have never seen
it. They are undoubtedly the thieves. How else
could they know so much about it?
King
: (Turning to Ram Datt) You, speak. What do you
know of this camel?

curtains
canopy:
(here) a cover

Ram Datt : Your Highness, I discovered that the camel is lame
in one of its legs.
King
: And how did you deduce this?
Ram Datt : Fromitstracksontheroad,Iobservedthatonlythree
feet left distinct impressions. The fourth was faint,
indicating a limp. The pattern of the tracks told the
tale of a creature struggling to bear its weight evenly.
King
: (Nodding thoughtfully) Impressive observation. You
have sharp eyes, indeed. (To Shiv Datt) And what of
you? What did you discern about this camel?
Shiv Datt : I observed that the camel was blind in its right eye,
Your Majesty.
King
: How did you arrive at this conclusion?
Shiv Datt : It had nibbled only on the foliage to the left of the
road, leaving the right side untouched. The leaves
on the right hung undisturbed, as if unseen. From
this, I deduced it could not see with its right eye.
King
: (Smiling) Well-reasoned indeed. Such detail is not
easily noticed by a casual traveller. (To Har Datt)
And your finding?
Har Datt : I
discovered
that
the
camel’s
tail
is
short,
Your Highness.
King
: Explain how you came to such a conclusion.
deduce: to
determine by
reasoning
discern: to
see or notice
something
foliage: green
leaves and
plantsWit and Wisdom
Har Datt : I noticed small droplets of blood along the track,
likely from mosquito bites. A camel with a long
tail would have fended off these pests with ease.
These small specks told me of an animal lacking
such defence, hence the short tail.
King
: (Impressed) You reasoned with great insight,
showing both observation and deduction. (Turning
to Dev Datt) And you, what did you observe that set
you apart from your companions?
Dev Datt : I noticed, Your Majesty, that the prints of the
camel’s forefeet were deep and clear, while those
of the sound hind foot were faint. This indicated
that the camel was drawing up its hind legs, likely
due to discomfort. It moved cautiously, burdened
by a pain in its belly, trying to spare itself further
suffering with every step.
King
: (Marvelling) Extraordinary! You have not seen the
camel, yet you know it intimately. Your reasoning
is flawless and speaks of wisdom that goes
beyond mere sight. (Turning to the Merchant) Your
accusations are baseless and misguided. These are
men of wisdom, not thieves. Go, and continue your
search for your camel, and be mindful of whom
you accuse in the future.
(The Merchant, chastened and embarrassed, bows
deeply and exits, his face red with shame.)
King
: (To the four men)
You

remarkable intelligence and the ability to see

valued in my court. I extend to you the honour of

King
: (Rising from his throne) Then let it be known
across the kingdom that four new advisers stand
by my side. May your wisdom shine upon Ujjain
and guide us to prosperity.
(The court erupts in applause as the King steps down
to greet his new advisers. The four men stand proud
and humbled, their journey fulfilled in a manner
they had never anticipated.)

Let us listen (refer to page 12)
I You will listen to a woman narrating a story. As you listen, fill in the
blanks for the following sentences given below by selecting the
correct options.
Hello everybody! Today I’ll be narrating a story about a
quick-witted courtier in the kingdom of Vijayanagara.
A renowned scholar, proud of his abilities, once visited the
kingdom of Vijayanagara. You see, he wanted to challenge the
scholarsinthecourtofKingKrishnadevaRaya.Thecourtscholars
did not want to accept the challenge as they were worried of
being defeated by the visitor. Besides this, they were also afraid
that the king would be angry if they refused to face the scholar.
They knew that only the quick-witted Tenali Rama would be
able to manage the situation. So, naturally, they asked him for
a solution. As expected, Rama told them that he would accept
the challenge.
The next day, Rama arrived at the palace. Rama and the
challenger sat facing each other. There was a bundle wrapped
in silk kept near Rama. He placed his hand on the bundle and
said to the visitor, “Let us start by discussing the merits of
tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana”. The visitor was taken aback. He
had read thousands of works. But he had never heard of this
work. He had no idea what to say. The scholar had to accept his
defeat. Ashamed, he quietly left the palace.
Now, the king was curious to know about the great work Rama
had mentioned. Rama smiled and removed the silk cloth. There
was a huge bundle of sticks tied with a thick rope! The king was
puzzled and asked for an explanation.
Rama told him, “O king! til is sesame; kashta is stick, tilakashta
means sticks of sesame plants”. Then, displaying the rope Rama
said, “This is the rope used to tie a buffalo—mahisha means
buffalo, bandhana means the rope used for tying—so, this is
tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana.”The king burst out laughing. The poor visitor had become scared
hearing such a difficult name. In this way, Rama had taught the
arrogant scholar a lesson.
II You will once again listen to the woman narrating the story. As you listen,
number the events of the story in the correct order of occurrence.
A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
Let us listen (refer to page 23)
I You will listen to a presentation about the wonderful Rock Garden
of Chandigarh. As you listen, answer the questions in one to three
exact words.
Hello everyone! The Rock Garden is a spacious open-air
exhibition. It is a proof of human creativity with waste materials.
This garden was created by Nek Chand, in 1957. This is the
reason the garden is also known as Nek Chand’s Rock Garden.
The garden was featured on an Indian postage stamp in 1983
and Nek Chand was awarded the Padma Shri a year later.
The Rock Garden is spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland.
Do you know why I say this? Well, it is because it has several
colourful sculptures and mosaic of art pieces.
What is unique about the Rock Garden is that it is divided into
three distinct phases. Each area reveals a unique collection
of installations including terracotta pots, light fixtures, and
even broken toilet pots, that have been transformed into
extraordinary masterpieces.
You will be surprised to know that the borders of the Rock Garden
are lined with around 5,000 statues. The Rock Garden is truly a
place that celebrates the best from waste. I sincerely recommend
that you visit this extraordinary national treasure.WISDOM PAVES THE WAY

I You will listen to four people sharing their thoughts on why they enjoy
witty characters in stories. As you listen, match statements 1–6 given
below to the speakers (i)–(iv). There are two statements you do not need.
Speaker (i) : I love witty characters because they make serious
situations funny! Even when things seem tense,
theyalwayshaveacleverresponse.Suchcharacters
never panic, think fast, and solve problems in the
smartest way. I wish I could think that quickly!
Speaker (ii) : Witty characters are the best because they make
stories exciting. I especially like how they turn
ordinary moments into something memorable. It
makes me feel like intelligence and humour are
just as powerful as strength.
Speaker (iii) : I enjoy witty characters because they always
have an answer for everything! They use humour
instead of fighting, and that’s really wonderful.
Even in folktales, they prove that smart thinking
can win over force. It makes me laugh but also
teaches me to stay calm in tricky situations.
Speaker (iv) : Witty characters add charm to a story. Their
intelligence
keeps
the
reader
engaged,
and
their humour makes learning fun. Whether it’s
a folktale or a modern one, a clever character
always stands out. I often feel that wit and wisdom
go hand-in-hand!
