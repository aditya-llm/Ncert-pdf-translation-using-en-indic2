sacrifice to protect the integrity of Indian borders. The day
began with the silence of a cold November dawn but ended
with echoes of courage that served as an inspiration for
generations to come.
This is the story of Major Somnath Sharma and the brave
men that he led on a mission to protect the Srinagar airport
from falling into the hands of a guerrilla force trained and
backed by Pakistan. This is a story of how 90 men managed to
foil the plan of some 500 infiltrators who wanted to capture

The events that led to the Battle of Badgam started in August
1947, when Pakistan launched Operation Gulmarg to annex the
annex: to take
possession of
Kashmir Valley. This was in violation of an existing agreement
with Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir,
who had committed Pakistan not to attack the state.
However, instead of honouring the commitment, the
Pakistani Army trained and equipped around 1000 invaders
who possessed deep knowledge of mountain passes and the
local terrain to enter Kashmir and take control of strategic
locations, including the Srinagar airport. The ultimate goal of
51

their plan was to engineer a revolt in Kashmir, overthrow the
government, and capture the territory. If they had succeeded,
it would have allowed them to control strategic mountain
passes, peaks, and rivers. On 22 October, Operation Gulmarg
was launched and these infiltrators invaded Kashmir,
which led to the Princely State becoming a part of India on
26 October 1947.
In response to this invasion, the Government of India sent its
troops to defend the people of Kashmir and India’s borders on
27 October 1947. A contingent of troops posted to Jammu and
Kashmir was airlifted into Srinagar because the land route
through Pathankot was not in a good condition.
On 31 October, the D Company of the 4th Battalion of Kumaon
Regiment, under the command of Major Somnath Sharma,
was also flown into Srinagar. At that time, Major Somnath
Sharma’s left hand was in plaster, but he insisted on being with
his company while in combat . He knew that this mission would

less than 5 kilometres away from the Srinagar airport. The
village was on a higher altitude than the airfield, and access
was through the village. Hence, it was important for Indian
forces to retain control of the area in order to protect troops
and facilitate supplies arriving via air.
In reality, the enemy had started arriving in Badgam in small
groups to avoid detection. On 03 November 1947, several
companies, including Major Somnath Sharma’s D Company,

of Indian soldiers were left behind in Badgam, they attacked
them. Their initial attack was met with stiff resistance by Major
Somnath and his men. However, Major Somnath correctly
visualised that the first attack was just a distraction. Shortly
thereafter, a major attack came from another side. By then,
Major Somnath Sharma and his 90 soldiers were facing about
500 invaders.
The Pakistani invaders sought to capture the Srinagar airfield
and its surrounding areas. It was clear to Major Somnath
Sharma that defending Srinagar town, the airfield, and the
wider valley was indeed difficult until reinforcements arrived.

Their brave resistance provided time for reinforcements to

to Srinagar. The heroic deeds of Major Somnath and his men
thoroughly demotivated the enemy, causing more than 300
casualties, including injuring their leader.

Birsa Munda, a revered tribal freedom fighter, spiritual leader,
and folk hero, belonged to the Munda tribe. Celebrated as a
valiant warrior and a charismatic figure, he emerged as a
powerful symbol of tribal resistance against British colonial
rule. Among the people of Jharkhand, he is affectionately
known as Dharti Aaba —Father of the Land—and is honoured
as a divine figure for his selfless dedication to his people.
A commemorative stamp designed by Shri Sankha Samanta captures his
powerful presence. It features Birsa Munda addressing his followers,
with a determined expression that reflects his unwavering vision of
tribal unity, empowerment, and self-governance. This stamp serves as
a lasting tribute to his pivotal role in India’s freedom struggle and his
relentless commitment to protecting tribal rights.

Alone, uncared for, amid the throng

Glad in the freedom of “school let out,”

Hailing the snow piled white and deep.
Past the woman so old and grey
Hastened the children on their way.
Nor offered a helping hand to her—
So meek, so timid, afraid to stir
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses’ feet
Should crowd her down in the slippery street.
At last came one of the merry troop,
The gayest laddie of all the group;
He paused beside her and whispered low,
“I’ll help you cross, if you wish to go.”
71
Poorvi
Her aged hand on his strong young arm
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm,
He guided the trembling feet along,
Proud that his own were firm and strong.
Then back again to his friends he went,
His young heart happy and well content.
“She’s somebody’s mother, boys, you know,
For all she’s aged and poor and slow”,
“And I hope some fellow will lend a hand
To help my mother, you understand”,
“If ever she’s poor and old and grey,
When her own dear boy is far away.”
And “somebody’s mother” bowed low her head
In her home that night, and the prayer she said
Was “God be kind to the noble boy,
Who is somebody’s son, and pride and joy!”

Lest the carriage wheels or the horses’ feet
Should crowd her down in the slippery street.
‘Lest’ is a conjunction that means to prevent something bad or
unpleasant from happening. To better understand its usage in a
sentence, we can replace ‘lest’ with ‘just in case’.
For example, in the sentence ‘ She showed all the documents lest we
doubt her’ , the word ‘lest’ can be replaced with ‘just in case’ to mean
that she showed the documents to prevent any doubt.

Your grandmother too made an important choice. She knew, in those

from the text.
1.… but that you should not be satisfied in merely keeping my awards—
the challenge before you was to earn your own rewards for the work
that you did in your lifetime.
2.Writing—even if it is a letter—not only conveys our present concerns
and views of the events taking place around us, but it becomes
apossession.
The highlighted punctuation is a long dash that can be used to link words
or numbers or to create a pause in a sentence. There are two main types:
the shorter en dash (–) and the longer em dash (—) .
The en dash (–) represents a span or range in numbers or dates.
For example, it can indicate time periods, like ‘train operates June–
September’ or page numbers, such as ‘refer to pages 50–75’ or to show
scores, ‘India won the series 2–1’.
The em dash (—) is used to add extra information or to show a change
in thought within a sentence. For example, ‘The exhibition—held in
the main hall—features local artists.’ Or ‘I bumped into someone
unexpected—my old teacher.’
Note: Do not add spaces around the dash and avoid overusing them.
Read the sentences below and insert either an em dash (—) or an
endash(–) suitably.
(i)
The conference will be held from March 15 March 20.
(ii)
I have lived in Kanpur Raipur for five years now.

IIIFinancial Literacy
Read the passage and discuss the questions given below.
Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to
children from an early age. Preparing children with financial literacy
skills is an investment for their future well-being. By imparting an
understanding of money, saving, budgeting, and wise spending, we
empower them to navigate the financial world with confidence as they
grow up.
Whether it is managing a cooperative society, a start-up, or a household
budget, financial literacy is an ongoing learning process that evolves
as children grow and their understanding deepens. An introduction
to concepts of saving, budgeting, investing, and responsible spending
equips them with essential life skills.
Children learn best through practical examples. Real-life situations help
them understand the value of money and the importance of making wise
financial choices. Thinking critically before spending helps cultivate
responsible habits. The concept of saving and investing can be explained
through relatable examples, such as planting seeds that grow into trees
bearing fruit.
As children grow older, they will learn to differentiate between needs
and wants, compare prices before making a purchase and understand
importance of financial literacy.
Discuss in groups.
1.The importance of learning about money and
saving from a young age. Share one example
ofit.
2.Imagine you received some money as a gift.
How would you decide whether to save it,
spend it, or invest it? What factors would you
consider?
3.If you were in charge of planning a small event
at school with a limited budget, how would
you manage the money?
4.Why is financial literacy important for
everyone?

Let us listen (refer to page 66)
IYou will listen to a talk about the Param Vir Chakra. As you listen, complete
the sentences by filling in the blanks with one or two exactwords or
phrases you hear.
Hello, everyone!
Let me tell you about the Param Vir Chakra. It is one of the
most prestigious awards in India and signifies the ‘Wheel of the
Ultimate Brave.’ This award is granted for ‘exemplary bravery in
the presence of the enemy.’ This means that this award is given to
someone who shows extraordinary courage and bravery while
fighting the enemy.
The medal was instituted as a Gallantry Medal with retrospective
effect from 15 August 1947 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the then
President of India. The medal was designed by Mrs. Savitri
Khanolkar, who drew inspiration from Sage Dadhichi, a Vedic
rishi, who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his body
so that the gods could create a deadly weapon called Vajra , or
Thunderbolt, from his spine.
The Param Vir Chakra is cast in bronze. At its centre, on a raised
circle, is the State Emblem of India. Surrounding it are four
replicas of Indra’s Vajra , lined with lotus flowers.
That, my dear friends, is the Param Vir Chakra, a true symbol
ofbravery.
Thank you.

IYou will listen to a woman read a special broadcast of the news. As
you listen, arrange the pictures in the correct sequence of events that
tookplace.
Now, for the special broadcast, we bring you the story of a
young hero whose courage has captured the nation’s heart.
On a fateful morning in Rajouri, young Rohan Ramchandra
Bahir, a 15-year-old student, became a local hero when he
fearlessly saved the life of a woman who had fallen into the
Domri River while washing clothes. The 43-year-old woman
was struggling to stay afloat in the strong currents, when
Rohan, without a moment’s hesitation, leapt into the river,
putting his own life at risk.
With great determination and courage, Rohan managed to
reach the woman and pull her to safety, despite the dangerous
conditions of the river. Onlookers who witnessed the incident
were in awe of the young boy’s bravery.
Rohan’s selfless act did not go unnoticed. His incredible
courage was recognised at Vigyan Bhawan, where he was
honoured with the prestigious Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal
Puraskar 2023 by the President of India, Droupadi Murmu.
This remarkable young boy is now a symbol of heroism
in his community, and his story is an inspiration to all. We
commend Rohan for his bravery and for showing that age is
no barrier when it comes to saving lives.

Verghese Kurien — I Too Had A Dream
Let us listen (refer to page 93)
IYou will listen to the passage about Evelyn Glennie’s journey in
overcoming her hearing loss through music and turning a physical
disability into a success story.
Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. By the time
she was 11 her performance in school had deteriorated and her
headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist. It was
then discovered that her hearing was severely impaired as a
result of gradual nerve damage. “Everything suddenly looked
black,” says Evelyn. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was
determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music.
One day she noticed a girl playing a xylophone and decided that
she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her
but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He began by
tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t listen through
your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” Says
Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from
the waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes
repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she
could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. “I had
learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” She
explains, “It pours in through every part of my body. It tingles
in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair.” The rest was
sheer determination and hard work. She never looked back
from that point onwards. And she got right to the top, the world’s
most sought-after multi percussionist with a mastery of some
thousand instruments.
